# Pedomus: A Pedagogical Aid using Gemini API

Pedomus is an innovative educational tool developed by Jayanth Vegesna and Mus Ab Ali. It enhances learning experiences by leveraging the Gemini API to provide interactive study sessions, allowing users to chat with PDFs, generate multiple-choice questions (MCQs), interact with simulations, and automate attendance tracking. The platform offers personalized dashboards for both students and teachers, streamlining classroom activities and study processes.

## Features

### 1. **Chat with PDFs**
   - Pedomus allows students to upload PDFs (e.g., textbooks, lecture notes) and interact with the content through a conversational interface.
   - Students can ask questions, summarize content, or get explanations directly from the uploaded documents.

### 2. **MCQ Generation**
   - Pedomus automatically generates multiple-choice questions based on PDF content to aid in self-assessment and preparation for exams.
   - Teachers can use this feature to quickly create assessments for their students.

### 3. **Interactive Simulations**
   - The platform integrates open-source HTML-based simulations that allow students to interact with and visualize complex concepts in various subjects.
   - These simulations help reinforce theoretical knowledge through hands-on learning experiences.

### 4. **Automated Attendance Tracking**
   - Pedomus simplifies classroom management by automating attendance tracking, making it easier for teachers to keep accurate records without manual effort.

### 5. **Student Dashboard**
   - Each student has access to a personalized dashboard where they can:
     - View study progress and completed interactions with PDFs.
     - Attempt MCQs and track quiz results.
     - Engage with simulations and see learning outcomes.
     - Check attendance records.

### 6. **Teacher Dashboard**
   - Teachers can manage their classes more efficiently with features to:
     - Monitor student performance in real-time.
     - Automatically track attendance.
     - Create custom quizzes based on PDF content.
     - Get insights into student engagement and simulation activities.
